# Applescript to filter mailing lists into imap folders.

Make a Apple Mail filter that matches on List-Id header. I use
"List-Id" "Does not contain" "NO MATCH", as Apple Mail does not
support checking for Header.  I *think* this only matches on mail with
this header set...

Choose "Run AppleScript" and this script as target.
